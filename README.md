### Fun facts

- At best, I can get MM rank at around `<pretending this="purple">`CHAOS 14`</pretending>` beatmaps in Cytus II.
- I like eating 🥚s, especially: 🍳.
- To me, different design systems are like:
  - **Material (original, Google)**: **absolutely the BEST of all**
  - **Material (since Android 9)**: Jesus, this is **NOT** design
  - **Fluent (Microsoft)**: great concept, $h!t implementation
  - **Team Fruity the Fruit (I mean the Cupertino one)**:
    - best at consistency (apart from MD)
    - iOS (7+) & iPadOS: overall good with great animations
    - macOS (Yosemite - Catalina): very elegant
    - macOS (Bug Sir (and possibly higher)): not so great, I mean disappointing
- I'm not single! ~~(you bet)~~
